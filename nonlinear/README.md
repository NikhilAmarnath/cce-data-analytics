The non-linear regression team is responsible for the following:

Multiple options for non-linear regression
	Parabolic
	Exponential
ACF
PACF

ACF:
The pages 38-41 of the textbook were used for this module. Using this module we can get:
- The auto-correlation(formula 2.11)
- The plot of the correlogram

This module could essentially be reused by the box-jenkins team to find the acf.
